## Use Cases 

Refer to the readme of every use case sub directory for a more through elaboration. 

1. **Credit Card Fraud**:  
This example shows the modelling of Credit Card Transaction Data using LSTM Autoencoder.  
The dataset used is large with almost 300 thousand datapoints, with normal data to fraud data having a ratio of 577:1.  
The results after 1 epoch is promising. Over 80% of frauds is identified correctly.
